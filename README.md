## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview  
This repository hosts a research-driven YouTube Video Recommendation System designed to improve user experience by **filtering clickbait content** and prioritizing high-quality videos through a **weighted ranking algorithm**. Unlike traditional popularity-driven systems, this framework integrates:  
- **Clickbait detection** (text, image, and thumbnail-caption disparity analysis).  
- **Dynamic weight adjustment** for features like likes/views ratio, sentiment scores, and comment strength.  
- **Transparent candidate generation** using the YouTube Data API.  

Built for academic research, this project addresses challenges such as misinformation, algorithmic bias, and content homogenization.
